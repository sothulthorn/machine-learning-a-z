## XGBoost

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and efficient machine learning algorithm based on gradient-boosted decision trees. It builds models sequentially, where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones using gradient-based optimization.

XGBoost is known for its high performance, regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, parallel processing, and strong results on structured and tabular data.
